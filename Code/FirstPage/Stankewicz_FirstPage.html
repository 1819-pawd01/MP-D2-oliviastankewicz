        <p> I play volleyball for Padua Academy. We practice <b>six</b> days a week for two hours, from 6:00-8:00pm. We usually have games on Tuesday's and Thursday's. I play travel volleyball for a club, called Delaware United. We practice two times a week and have tournaments on the weekends.</p>

        <p>Over this past summer, I traveled to <b>London</b>. We stayed for seven days and six nights. My favorite part was going in the London eye to see a huge part of the city up high up. I love to go to the beach. I only go to the beach for one week in the entire summer. I never go to Delaware beaches, I only go to beaches on Long Island, NY.</p>

        <p>My favorite color is a light pink. I do not have a favorite movie but I enjoy funny, action, and sad movies. I have <em>a lot</em> of favorite TV shows, such as <em>Grey's Anatomy, Friends, Parks and Recreation, and the Office</em>. When I grow up, I want to be a doctor. I want to be a pediatric orthopedic or a trama doctor. My family is pretty small. I have one sister and three counsin. I try not to eat fast food a lot, but I had to choose a fast food resturant, it would have to be Chick-fil-A. I love dogs, but not cats, since I am allergic to them. I do not have a pet but I really want a Cavapoo. A quote is:</p>
        <blockquote> I believe that everything <br /> Happens for a reason. <br />People change so that you can<br /> learn to let go. <br />Things go wrong so that <br />you appreciate them <br />when they're right, <br />you believe lies so you eventually <br /> learn to trust no one but yourself, <br />And sometimes good things fall apart<br /> So better things can fail together.</blockquote>
