        <h3>"Ghost Town" Pine Barrens, N. J. </h3>
        <p>Ever wondered what lies deep in the New Jersey Pine Barrens?</p>
        <p>The one million-acre reserve is home to more history and legends than that of the Jersey Devil, as it turns out. </p>
        <p>Barbara Solem, a Pine Barrens expert and author of "Ghost Towns: And Other Quirky Places in the New Jersey Pine Barrens," takes groups of more than a dozen people to trek around the sites with the local tourist and outdoor group Pinelands Adventures. And those sites, scattered through the heart of the Pine Barrens, are remnants of a different world. Known today for its lush forests, hiking trails and lakes and streams for kayaking and canoeing, the area was once a bustling industrial center, where iron, paper, glass and bricks were manufactured, capitalizing on the area's streams and plentiful wood to power forges, mills and factories." </p>
        <p>People flocked to those sites from the 18th to 20th centuries, seeking low-paying, but seemingly stable, jobs and the chance to grab some land of their own. But eventually, opportunities faded, and so did the liveliness of many Pine Barrens towns. Today, much of that history of New Jersey's suburban wilderness is visible only by its leftovers -- and its legends." </p>
        <p>Those legends and histories wind through former small towns, across more than a dozen sites. Some are preserved to reflect their original state, and others are nearly gone, visible only to the trained eye. </p>
        <p>But Solem's tour gives insight into those long-gone power players who shaped the Pine Barrens in the nation's earlier days, and how their influence declined over time, creating the massive, protected forest we all know today."</p>

        <h3>History of the Pinelands</h3>
        <p>"Today's Pinelands are a result of geological transformations occurring over millenia, with humans beginning to shape the landscape 10,000 years ago.</p>
        <p>European settlement brought towns and industries to the Pines, and began to change the landscape in ways previously unseen. The ghostly remains of industrial villages like Martha, where an iron furnace operated in the early 1800s, and Harrisville, where a paper mill flourished in the late 1800s, can still be seen. Company towns like Double Trouble Village, a cranberry farm and packing plant, and Whitesbog Village, where Elizabeth White domesticated the blueberry, are today well-preserved examples of a bygone way of life in the Pines.</p>
        <p>Today, several hunderd thousand people inhabit the Pinelands, with many commuting to employment centers on the edge of the Philadelphia metropolitan region. And while the manufacturing industries of previous generations have faded away, large-scale cranberry and blueberry farming continue to provide an economic foundation for the region."</p>

        <h3>Fun Facts about Pine Barrens, N. J.</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>"The 1.1-million-acre Pinelands Natural Reserve stretches south and west from northern Ocean County and makes up 22 percent of New Jersey’s total land mass.</li>
            <li>European settlers found the sandy, acidic soil unsuited to farming and left the land largely untouched, but beneath the pines lies a natural reservoir of bacterially sterile, chemically pure H2o that the U.S. Geological Survey has compared to “uncontaminated rain-water or melted glacial ice.” This water, tinted like tea from tannins from cedar trees and iron from the ground, was once prized by sea captains to take along on voyages because it stayed potable longer than any other water.</li>
            <li>Early “Pineys,” as Barrens residents call themselves, included Quakers who’d been expelled from their meetings for fighting in the Revolution; outlaws and smugglers; and Tory loyalists known as the Refugees who, despite their politics, rode in packs and killed and robbed indiscriminately. </li>
            <li>The Barrens became home to several industries in the course of their history, including charcoal-making, glass-making (the first Mason jar was made here), woodcutting and cabinetry. Benjamin Randolph, a cabinetmaker in Speedwell, crafted the writing desk at which Thomas Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence.</li>
            <li>During the American Revolution, highly absorbent sphagnum moss gathered from the Barrens stood in when needed for cloth bandages, and in later years, it was packed into florists’ boxes as protection for the blossoms inside." </li>

        <h3>Reviews</h3>
        <blockquote> <i>"When I went to Pine Barrens, New Jersey, I was so scared at first. It was around Halloween time and they told me their was a devil within the forests. My heart started pounding and I started second guessing taking them there with their friends, but they convinced me. Once I got there, I had a blast. There were so many activities to do with my kids and their friends. I would 10/10 recommend this place." - Ravi Burger </i></blockquote>
        <blockquote><i>"This place was so haunted... The whole time I was so scared. We were camping by the river and I kept hearing noises, but it turned out it was just my husband trying to scare me. He said it wasn't him and it was the "devil" and I believed him up until we left the campsite. I am going to recommend this place to all of my friends and family when I get back home." -Sally Smith </i></blockquote>
        <blockquote> <i> "This place was so much fun and had such nice scenary. It was a bit scary and I could hear rumbling in the bushes, but overall it was a great experience!" - Tommy Llama </i></blockquote>
